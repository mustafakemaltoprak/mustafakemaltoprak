## Hi, I am Tina 👋

I am a Fullstack developer 👩‍💻 who likes to code in Javascript, enjoys talking about serverless architecture and is searching for the perfect CICD pipeline. When I am not in front of a computer, you can find my exploring food markets 🥡, going up (🥾) or down (🏂) mountains or struggling with finger picking 🎸.
